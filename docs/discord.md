## Quest Lifecycle

> **ID format:** All quest, character, and summary identifiers use postal-style values such as `QUESH3X1T7` or `CHARB2F4D9`. Slash commands expect the full ID string (including prefix).
> Demo logs for quest actions surface these postal IDs directly so moderators can cross-check announcements.
