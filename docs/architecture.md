# Nonagon Architecture

> Discord-based quest automation, summaries, and participation tracking.

## 1. Purpose & Scope

Nonagon automates quest workflows (announce >> sign‑ups >> roster selection >> run >> summaries) and captures participation telemetry for insights. This document describes the architecture: runtime components, layering, data model, workflows, observability, deployment, and testing.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

**Style:** Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) with a thin MVC at the edge.

- **Delivery (Controllers/Views):** Discord Cogs handle commands & events (controllers). UI is built with `discord.ui.View` (buttons/selects/modals) and presenters that render embeds.
- **Application Layer (Use Cases):** Stateless orchestrators (e.g., `CreateQuest`, `ApplyForQuest`, `SelectRoster`, `SubmitSummary`) that coordinate domain models and repositories.
- **Domain Layer (Models):** Pure Python dataclasses modeling `User` (+ roles & profiles), `Quest`, and `QuestSummary`. Contains invariants and state transitions.
- **Adapters (Infra):** Repositories for MongoDB, configuration, and integrations (Discord message IDs linkage). Optional background jobs for projections/analytics.

```bash
[ Discord (slash cmds, buttons) ]
           |
        Controllers (Cogs)  ←→  Views (discord.ui.View + presenters)
           |
        Application (Use Cases)  ←→  Ports (Repo interfaces)
           |
          Domain (Entities/Value Objects)
           |
        Adapters (MongoDB repos, schedulers, config)
```

**Why this shape?**

- Domain rules remain framework‑agnostic.
- UI/Discord specifics live at the edge and can change without touching core logic.
- Repositories can be swapped (e.g., MongoDB → Postgres) with minimal surface changes.

## 3. Runtime Components

### 3.1 Discord Edge

- **Cogs (Controllers):** Register slash commands/listeners, validate permissions, **defer** within 3s, call use cases, then send/edit messages.
- **Views (UI):** `discord.ui.View` classes own component callbacks; presenters build embeds.
- **Rate limiting:** centralized wrapper handles retries/backoff when editing messages.

#### 3.1.1 DM Wizard Patterns

We standardize DM-driven workflows around an interactive preview message with persistent controls:

- **Single preview message.** Wizards open with a DM that includes the latest preview embed and a `discord.ui.View` for navigation.
- **Button-driven edits.** Each field is managed by a button that opens a modal. Modals validate inputs immediately and re-render the shared preview on success.
- **Contextual confirmations.** A dedicated "Create"/"Save" button confirms changes, while a paired cancel button exits gracefully.
- **Consistent feedback.** Errors use the shared `send_ephemeral_message` helper (or the `_flash_message` wrapper in sessions) so responses match the friendly tone across Quest and Character flows.
- **Shared components.** DM sessions use classes from `app.bot.ui.wizards` (`WizardSessionBase`, `PreviewWizardContext`, `PreviewWizardView`, and shared modal/validation helpers) to keep copy, validation, and lifecycle behavior aligned.

When implementing a new DM wizard, construct it around these shared pieces so both quests and characters present the same interaction model.

#### 3.1.2 Discord Intents

The user telemetry feature set relies on Discord gateway events that are only delivered when the corresponding intents are enabled both in code and on the developer portal. Ensure the following are turned on before deploying analytics collectors:

- MESSAGE CONTENT — required to receive full `MESSAGE_CREATE` payloads to increment message counters and derive activity timestamps.
- GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS — surfaces `REACTION_ADD` / `REACTION_REMOVE` for reaction metrics.
- GUILD_MEMBERS — exposes `on_member_join` data to seed `joined_at` and supply member snowflakes for lookups.
- GUILD_VOICE_STATES — streams join/leave transitions to accumulate voice-session durations.

All four intents must be requested in `discord.Intents` during bot startup. The privileged intents (MESSAGE CONTENT, GUILD_MEMBERS) also need to be explicitly approved in the Discord developer portal. Capture approval screenshots or ticket IDs for future reference.

### 3.2 Application (Use Cases)

- One file per action; no framework imports. Examples:

  - `create_quest`, `announce_quest`, `apply_for_quest`, `select_roster`, `mark_completed`
  - `submit_summary` (DM or player)
  - `record_message_activity`, `record_event_attendance`

### 3.3 Domain (Models)

- **User** with `roles[]` and optional `player`/`referee` profiles.
- **Quest** with lifecycle (`DRAFT → SIGNUP_OPEN → ROSTER_SELECTED → RUNNING → COMPLETED/CANCELLED`), sign‑ups, roster, waitlist, Discord linkage, telemetry.
- **QuestSummary** unified with discriminator `kind = player|dm`, visibility policy.

### 3.4 Adapters (Infra)

- **MongoDB repositories:** implement ports for `UsersRepo`, `QuestsRepo`, `SummariesRepo`.
- **Config:** environment‑driven (`.env` in dev); no secrets in code.
- **Background jobs (optional):** projectors to compute analytics/materialized views.

## 4. Key Workflows

### 4.1 Quest Announcement & Sign‑ups

1. `/quest_create` defers, calls `create_quest()` → returns `Quest` in `DRAFT`.
2. Controller posts announcement with `SignupView` and stores `guild_id/channel_id/message_id/thread_id` on the quest.
3. Calls `announce_quest()` → status becomes `SIGNUP_OPEN`.
4. Players click **Sign up** → `apply_for_quest()` adds `Signup` entries; presenter updates counts.

### 4.2 Roster Selection

1. DM triggers **Select Roster** (modal/select) → `select_roster()` validates ownership & capacity, promotes selected to `roster`, others to `waitlist`.
2. Controller edits the sign‑up message embed and optionally DMs selected players.

### 4.3 Run & Complete

1. When session starts, controller calls `quest.mark_running()` via use case, later `mark_completed()` which sets `summary_needed=True`.
2. Players/DM submit summaries via buttons/modals → `submit_summary(kind=player|dm)` links to quest and updates stats.

---

## 5. Data Model (High‑level)

### 5.1 Core Entities

- **User**

  - `roles: [member|player|referee|admin]`
  - `player?: PlayerProfile` (active/retired characters, counters)
  - `referee?: RefereeProfile` (quests DMed, regions, collaborations)
  - Engagement telemetry (messages, voice, events).

- **Quest**

  - Identity, meta (`name`, `description`, `tags`, `category`, `region`)
  - Scheduling (`scheduled_at`, `duration_minutes`, `timezone`)
  - Capacity (`max_players`, `min_players`, optional level range)
  - Discord linkage (`guild_id`, `channel_id`, `signup_message_id`, `thread_id`)
  - Lifecycle timestamps; `signups`, `roster`, `waitlist`
  - Rewards (`xp_reward`, `gp_reward`), `summary_ids`, `attendees`

- **QuestSummary** (unified)

  - `summary_id`, `quest_id`, `author_user_id`, `kind`, `summary_text`, `posted_at`
  - Visibility (`is_private`, `audience_roles`)

### 5.2 Modeling Notes

- Prefer **IDs** over object references in maps to avoid cycles; easy serialization.
- Embed small, tightly‑coupled subdocs (profiles, sign‑ups). Split to collections when they grow or need independent indexing/lifecycle.

### 5.3 ID Strategy

- All domain IDs (`USER`, `CHAR`, `QUES`, `SUMM`) now use postal-style bodies: `PREFIX` + `L#L#L#` (e.g., `QUESH3X1T7`).
- MongoDB documents persist IDs under `*.value`; repositories and caches compare against those values instead of `_id` or legacy `.number` fields.
- Legacy numeric bodies remain parseable for backfilled data, but new records generate postal bodies via `EntityIDModel.generate()`.
- Demo tooling and command surfaces surface the postal IDs to keep Discord embeds and logs aligned with repository values.

---

## 6. Security & Permissions

- **RBAC:** roles derive from `User.roles`. Controllers enforce: only `REFEREE` may create/select, only `PLAYER` may apply, `ADMIN/REFEREE` may read DM summaries.
- **Visibility:** DM summaries default private; player summaries public unless overridden.
- **Audit:** record `created_by`, `last_updated_by` on quests; append‑only events for sensitive changes (optional).

---

## 7. Reliability & Performance

- **Interaction timing:** always reply or **defer** within 3 seconds; then edit/follow‑up.
- **Rate limits:** centralize message edits with automatic retry/backoff; deduplicate identical edits; prefer bulk updates.
- **Idempotency:** use deterministic keys (e.g., signup composite `(quest_id, user_id, character_id)`) to prevent double‑apply.
- **Pagination & caching:** paginate lists (quests, summaries); cache stable lookups (e.g., user profiles) in memory with TTL.

---

## 8. Observability

- **Structured logging** with request/interaction IDs.
- **Metrics** (per command latency, error rate, rate‑limit hits, sign‑up conversions).
- **Tracing**: optional OpenTelemetry (spans around use cases and Discord/DB adapters). Export to console in dev; OTLP in prod.

### 8.1 Moderation SOP

#### Quest Nudge Auditing

- Every quest nudge posts a gold "Quest Nudge" embed in the quest channel and includes a link back to the announcement message.
- The bot records each nudge via `send_demo_log`, emitting a guild-scoped entry with the referee mention and quest title.
- Moderators should review the demo log stream during weekly check-ins to confirm nudges stay within the 48h cooldown cadence.
- If a nudge occurs too soon, remind the referee that cooldown enforcement is automatic and note the attempt for follow-up.

---

## 9. Deployment & Config

- **Packaging:** `src/` layout; every package has `__init__.py`.
- **Configuration:** env vars (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`, `BOT_TOKEN`, `LOG_LEVEL`). Commit only `.env.example`.
- **Container:** Bring your own container or managed Postgres; set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly. No maintained Compose setup in-repo.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions runs `ruff`/`pytest`.

---

## 10. Testing Strategy

- **Unit:** domain models (state transitions), use cases (with in‑memory repos/UoW).
- **Component:** adapters against a real MongoDB (or Testcontainers/mongomock for fast checks).
- **E2E (bot):** spin up a test guild or use a stub transport; verify commands and views.

---

## 11. Extensibility

- Add **analytics projections** (e.g., “quests per referee”, “time‑to‑fill”).
- New integrations (web dashboard, notifications) arrive as new adapters/ports.
- Feature flags for experimental flows.

---

## 12. Assumptions

- MongoDB Atlas is the primary store; scale via indexes and capped document sizes.
- Single bot shard initially; can shard later if guild count grows.
- Discord UI is the only delivery mechanism for now (no public HTTP API).
